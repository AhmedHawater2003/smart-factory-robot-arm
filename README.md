2. You will clone this repo ( which has the FreeRTOS library installed ) by executing `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AhmedHawater2003/smart-factory-robot-arm.git`
3. Modify the project configuration and add the installed pico-kit by following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cDpGoCyrHQ) (Skip the cloning part and go directly to the CMake configuration part)
